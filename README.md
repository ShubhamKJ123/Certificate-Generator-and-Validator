## Project Summary
* The idea behind this project is to generate certificates in PDF, PNG, and JPEG formats, providing flexibility to Admin for generating 
  multiple certificates for different users at once and storing their information in Database.
* Front-end technologies used are HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interface and interactivity of the application.
* Back-end technologies used are PHP and MySQL. Php is used for server-side scripting for database operations, and MySQL is used for 
  database integration for storing user information.
